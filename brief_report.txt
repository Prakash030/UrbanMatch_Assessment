Brief Report:

Several crucial factors and design decisions were taken into account when creating the user management and matchmaking system to guarantee efficient functionality and performance:

    1. Data Schema Modification: In order to overcome the SQL database's restriction with Array data types, the interests column in the users table was converted to a comma-separated string format. This change maintains effective user interest storage and retrieval while remaining compatible with the current database.
    2. Endpoint Configuration:
        Endpoints for Users:
            Update User: Uses user_id to allow changes to user information.
            Delete User: Enables a user to be deleted using their user_id from the database.
            Matchmaking: Assists in locating possible matches by using the user's profile, which includes information on gender, age range, and shared interests.
        Email validation: To improve data integrity, Pydantic's EmailStr was used to make sure email addresses are in a valid format before storing or processing user data.
    3. Logic of Match Making: 
        Based on shared interests, age range, and gender, profiles are matched:
            Gender: When matching, only profiles with the opposite gender are taken into account.
            Age Range: The user's age is the range of ±5 years in which matches are sought after.
            Common Interests: For a profile to be considered a match, there must be a minimum of one shared interest.
        Based on the user's preferences and profile details, this method guarantees that matches are pertinent and significant.

Assumptions Made:
    1. Presumed that Array data types are not supported by the SQL database, so the interests must be entered in a comma-separated string format.
    2. Given that age and interests are essential for precise matchmaking, it is assumed that user profiles will contain accurate and consistent information.
    3. All interests were converted to lowercase for matching since it was assumed that interests are comparable in a case-insensitive way.
    4. It is assumed that, despite differences in capitalization, gender data will be consistently represented in the database as either "male" or "female".
    5. Assumed that, in order to find relevant matches while maintaining inclusivity and relevance, an age range of ±5 years is appropriate.
